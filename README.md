# How to start the project

1) Install the node_modules by using command `npm install`
2) For development, create `.env` in the project root directory. 
    For this purpose, there is a file named `.env.example`, 
    you can use that file.
3) After the node_modules have been installed and .env has been created, run the following command
    `npm run run`
